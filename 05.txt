Ques: List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.

Ans: The most common types of classification are:-
1. Hierarchical databases:-
 In a hierarchical database, data is organized in a tree-like structure, with each record having a parent record and any number of child records. This type of database is easy to understand and implement, but it can be difficult to query and update data.
2. Network databases:-
 In a network database, data is organized in a network-like structure, with each record having any number of parent records and child records. This type of database is more flexible than a hierarchical database, but it can be more difficult to understand and implement.
3. Relational databases:-
 In a relational database, data is organized in tables, with each table having a set of columns and rows. This type of database is the most common type of database, and it is easy to understand, implement, and query.
4. Object-oriented databases:-
 In an object-oriented database, data is organized in objects, which are entities that have both data and methods. This type of database is more flexible than a relational database, but it can be more difficult to understand and implement.
5. NoSQL databases:-
 NoSQL databases are a type of database that does not use the traditional relational model. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and to be able to scale easily.
